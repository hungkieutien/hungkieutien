# Hello 😊

## About Me

🌍 Location: Würzburg

💼 Occupation: snapADDY GmbH

🌱 I’m currently learning: React 

📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hung-kieu-tien/)

I love building tools that are user-friendly, simple and minimalistic.
During my studies I learned the basics of front-end and back-end web development. Currently I'm dedicated to learn React to take my web development skills to the next level. For this reason, I am currently working very intensively with React privately and building up a portfolio in parallel.

Through my work experiences in the last four years, I had the opportunity to work with cross-functional teams and different technologies. Although back-end development has been my main area over the past time, I wanted to expand my skills in the front-end development. This versatility allows me to work effectively at different stages of a project's development and ensure that the final products are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

I'm currently looking for a new role as a developer with a focus on React.

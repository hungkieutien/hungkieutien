# Hello! I'm Hung Kieu ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)

## About Me

🌍 Location: Würzburg

💼 Occupation: netgrade GmbH

🌱 I’m currently learning: React 

📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hung-kieu-tien/)

I love building tools that are user-friendly, simple and minimalistic.
During my studies I learned the basics of front-end and back-end web development. Currently I'm dedicated to learn React to take my web development skills to the next level.

Through my work experiences in the last four years, I had the opportunity to work with cross-functional teams and different technologies. Although back-end development has been my main area over the past time, I wanted to expand my skills in the front-end development. This versatility allows me to work effectively at different stages of a project's development and ensure that the final products are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

I'm currently looking for a new role as a developer with a focus on React.

# Hello ðŸ˜Š

I am passionate about building user-friendly, simple, and minimalistic tools. Throughout my studies, I developed a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end web development. Currently, I am focused on expanding my expertise by working on a personal project to build an e-commerce shop, utilizing a modern tech stack: Nuxt 3 (with TypeScript), NestJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, and JWT for authentication. While the project is still in its early stages, it plays a crucial role in helping me build a new skill set and further develop my portfolio.

Over the past five years, Iâ€™ve worked with cross-functional teams and diverse technologies. While I initially specialized in back-end development, Iâ€™ve expanded my skill set to include front-end development as well. This versatility enables me to contribute effectively across different phases of a project, ensuring that the final product is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
